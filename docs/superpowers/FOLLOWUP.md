# FOLLOWUP — session handoff

If you are a fresh session: read `CLAUDE.md` first, then this file, then act on "Next step"
immediately.

## Where things stand (2026-10-10)

`master` is at `8dd7520` ("All Done."), pushed, and the tree is clean apart from this note. All the
work listed below is **committed and pushed**; it still awaits the user's phone check:

- **Boot screen** (`index.html`, `public/boot-knob.svg`, `src/main.ts`): only the knob, centred and
  slowly spinning as the loading indicator, blank dark brushed-metal LCD matching the in-app knob
  (regenerated from `knob.ts` lcdStops), four-colour box-shadow (teal left, light-theme orange
  `#ee9448` right, chrome bottom-left, blue bottom-right). No fade; no live-knob snapshot. Tapping
  the knob plays the 140 BPM loop and shows the spinning ring around it; tapping outside closes
  the title-button preview.
- **Audio start hang** (`audioEngine.ts`, `transport.ts`): suspend only 45 s after stop; silent
  unlock `play()` not awaited; `ensureRunning()` retries on a fresh AudioContext after a 1.5 s
  stuck resume. Blinking knob + toast removed; a real failure shows index.html's reload screen
  (`window.showReloadScreen`). Boot-loop context is suspended when the loop stops.
- **Sounds**: 5 new presets (Claves, Log drum, Cowbell, Drum kit, Digital). Sci-fi group removed:
  lasers/phaser deleted, Metal Impact 1–3 → drums, Tone → built-in, stale built-in ids fall back
  to defaults in `sanitizeSettings`.
- **Polyrhythm**: coincident layer hits are scaled so the pair peaks like one click (fixes downbeat
  distortion; `PolyBeatEvent.otherIndex`), poly gains lowered to 0.8/0.88/1.08. Layer A/B sound
  pickers moved from the Signature dialog to the Sound dialog (which hides the accent/other
  cards and level volumes in poly mode; presets fill A/B). The top-right Polyrhythm tag is a
  button (opens Signature) with a ✕ back to standard mode.

- **Sound dialog extras**: presets are a dropdown (shared picker popover via
  `openChoicePicker` in `soundPicker.ts`, ▶ plays the pair); user-saved presets
  (`Settings.customPresets`, max 20) with a save form and a trash + ✕/✓ confirm
  (`src/ui/deleteConfirm.ts`, extracted from main.ts, also used by timer and loop pill); ↺ reset
  buttons on master/accent/medium/normal volume. Coincident poly hits use equal-power scaling.
- **2026-10-10, not yet seen in a browser** (dev server was killed for low memory): the boot-screen
  easter egg now opens from the centre dial hub (`#dialHub`, no pointer cursor) instead of the
  title; the title now opens the menu like ☰; light theme title glow is the four accents at 0.5.
- **Easter egg redo (2026-10-10, pushed untested):** loop gain 0.7; knob spins 20 beats/turn at
  rest, playbackRate ramps to 5x (4 beats/turn) while playing; the beat circle is replaced by 8
  compass-start branches (`src/ui/bootBranches.ts`, lazy chunk, CSS-animated, re-planned each
  12-beat cycle with overlap rejection). Needs a phone look at 320/360px for overlap/clipping.
- **Boot knob = Android splash (2026-10-10):** `scripts/boot-knob.cjs` builds `public/boot-knob.svg`
  (body + baked mint halo, spins) and `public/boot-glyph.svg` (static play glyph) from `icon.svg`;
  loader art is 216px on #141416 like the splash (CENTER scale type). No box-shadow. Branch fade
  starts/ends at opacity 0 (suspected wrap-frame flash); branches reach 80% of the way to each edge.
  Rerun the script after editing `icon.svg`.
- **Easter egg tempo = 140 BPM** (user-confirmed; onset analysis agrees, the file is 63.1 beats / 27.042 s
  long). `--beat: calc(60s / 140)` in index.html, `BOOT_BPM` in main.ts. Visuals start on the first
  heard beat (`.boot-synced`), animations are shifted back by the 42 ms loop remainder each loop,
  and the knob pin is steered to point up on beats 1, 5, 9... (P-controller on playbackRate).
- **Top-right tabs are now Circle | Line | Poly** (`vizSwitch.ts`): Poly = polyrhythm mode (same
  setting as the Signature dialog); Circle/Line also switch polyrhythm off. The old Polyrhythm tag
  with ✕ is gone. App rename leaning Orbit (title "Orbit: Metronome" on Play, "Orbit" in-app).
- **Open questions to the user**: what "title ortak olmalı with the menu button" means if not
  "opens the menu"; app rename — suggested Orbit (recommended), TempoDial, Kadran, Pulse Ring,
  Ritmo; check Play Store availability once picked. Boot animation will be revised later.
- **Play closed testing**: user plans Testers Community Starter (₺499, 15 testers) plus friends
  via a Play Console email list on the same closed track; needs a signed AAB first.

All 275 tests pass; type-check and lint are clean.

### App icon: what shipped in the commit

- `public/icon.svg`: knob with gear teeth, dark metallic LCD, and only a play glyph in the centre
  (no BPM digits). The glyph keeps its `M238 224V288L292 256Z` geometry but is a green metal
  gradient lit from the top right. Never change the in-app knob (`src/ui/knob.ts`) for icon work.
- Android launcher icon is a real adaptive icon: `@color/iconBackground` (`#000000`) + knob
  foreground inside the 66dp safe zone. Launcher icons only (adaptive foreground + legacy
  `ic_launcher.png`) get a stronger mint halo (0.7/0.3) and lifted colours
  (`modulate({ brightness: 1.22, saturation: 1.15, lightness: 4 })`) so they read on dark home
  screens. Splash, Play `store_icon.png`, PWA and Tauri icons keep the original tones. The unused
  `ic_maskable` mipmaps are gone.
- Regenerate all icons after editing `public/icon.svg`: `npm run generate-pwa-assets`,
  `npx tauri icon public/icon.svg`, `node scripts/android-icons.cjs`. The script reproduces the
  installed build's 18 Android/Play/splash files byte-for-byte. Bubblewrap project regeneration
  would overwrite `ic_launcher.xml` and the icons: re-run the script afterwards.
- Debug builds install next to the Play app as `com.psymore.metronome.test` ("Metronome Test",
  `android/app/build.gradle`). The current debug build (19:51) is on the test phone.

### App icon: what we learned on the test phone

Test phone: Redmi Note 10 Pro (M2101K6G), MIUI 14 `V14.0.2.0.TKFTRXM`, Android 13, launcher
`com.miui.home` 4.39.7.

- Android paints adaptive layers over **black** (`AdaptiveIconDrawable.draw()`), so a transparent
  background shows black on every launcher; the background layer must be opaque.
- The launcher, not the app, picks the icon shape. MIUI 14's default theme masks layered icons
  with a squircle. The phone's earlier 2022 theme had no layered-icon support: it flattened every
  app it had no hand-drawn PNG for onto a small square tile, and its hand-drawn round Instagram PNG
  was why Instagram looked round. The user switched to the default theme at 17:57.
- `roundIcon` is ignored on this phone (`config_useRoundIcon = false`); MIUI uses the anydpi-v26
  adaptive XML, not the legacy PNG.
- The phone also has a Chrome-installed PWA called "Metronome" (WebAPK, 2026-10-01) with the old
  icon. It refreshes only after the new web icons are deployed and Chrome updates it.

### Earlier follow-ups still open

- **Phone check of the light theme beats** (ink ladder, hit lift).
- **Phone checks:** +/- long-press, signature wheel scrolling, Save/Cancel; 320/360px widths.
- **Timer/loop overlap** on narrow phones: ask whether both may be active.
- **Tests and lint are green again** (275 tests, `npm run lint` clean as of 2026-10-09); CI
  should pass once this work is pushed.
- **Android Play Store:** Play Console setup, AAB build/signing, closed testing, production per
  `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-09-24-mobile-performance-and-play-store-v2.md`. The new icon needs a
  new Play release; signing needs the user's permission to read the keystore password file.

### Standing instructions

- **Never work in a git worktree.** Committing and pushing straight to `master` is fine.
- No `Co-Authored-By` lines in commits.
- Ask before every build, install, and commit.
- The user tests on a physical Android phone (Chrome) against the dev server Network URL, and
  over adb (`D:\Android\Sdk\platform-tools\adb`) when the phone is plugged in. Do not screenshot
  the phone unless the launcher is in front (check `dumpsys window`).
- Keep turns economical; no tests unless asked; no reflexive build/test runs for tiny changes.

## Next step

1. Restart the dev server only when the user asks; they check the 2026-10-10 changes on the phone
   and report what to fix. Commit/push fixes only after asking (build first).
2. Get answers on the open questions (app rename, "title ortak" meaning).
3. The beat ring on the boot screen will be redesigned ("orayı başka türlü değiştireceğiz").
4. Remaining open items above as directed.
